Analysis

Velocity is given by:

    v = t0

Define t0 as the time we wait.
Define T as the total time for the race, then the time while moving is given by

    t = T - t0

Distance is velocity * t:

    d = t0(T - t0)
    d = t0(T) - t0^2

Max d can be found by taking derivative and setting to 0, with
t0 as the variable:

    d' = T - 2t0 = 0
    t0 = T/2

So we should charge for half the time to get max distance

To beat the current record, we want

    d = t0(T - t0) > D
